h3. Activating EMF Compare on a given file extension


EMF compare uses a content-type to know whether it should be used for comparison. This content-type will initially register itself against .ecore and .uml files. 
You may add your own extension using the Preferences view / Global / Content-types and adding your file extension in the "EMF Compare" content-type.
