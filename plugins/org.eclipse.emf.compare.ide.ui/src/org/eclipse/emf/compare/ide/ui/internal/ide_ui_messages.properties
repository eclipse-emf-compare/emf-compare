ModelResolverRegistry.invalidResolver = Model resolver ''{0}'' could not be instantiated.
ModelResolverRegistry.invalidRanking = Ranking of resolver ''{0}'' was not a valid integer : ''{1}''.

ModelResolver.coherenceWarning = Some models were accessible from multiple compared files and have been removed from the scope. This could break their references to the compared models as a result of merge operations.

resource.not.serializable = Resource is not serializable.

redo.menu.item.text = Merge

CompareSelfWithAncestor = Cannot run a comparison between an object and one of its ancestors.

wait.viewer.desc = Please wait for the comparison computation to finish...
wait.viewer.title = Please wait...
no.differences.viewer.desc = No differences detected for this comparison.
no.differences.viewer.title = No differences detected.
no.visible.item.viewer.desc = No visible item with this set of filters/group.\nPlease enable/disable filters, or change group to see items.
no.visible.item.viewer.title = No visible item.
no.selected.item.viewer.desc = No selected item in the top panel.
no.selected.item.viewer.title = No selected item.

ModelResolutionPreferencesPage.disableResolvers = Disable model resolution
ModelResolutionPreferencesPage.disableThreading = Disable multi-threading during model resolution
ModelResolutionPreferencesPage.resolutionScope = Resolution scope:
ModelResolutionPreferencesPage.resolutionScope.description = The model resolvers will try and find cross referenced resources starting from the compared one in order to determine the logical model that needs to be compared along with it. This can be used to widen or reduce the scope in which EMF Compare will seek these linked resources.
ModelResolutionPreferencesPage.resolutionScope.workspace.label = Workspace
ModelResolutionPreferencesPage.resolutionScope.project.label = Project
ModelResolutionPreferencesPage.resolutionScope.container.label = Container
ModelResolutionPreferencesPage.resolutionScope.outgoing.label = Outgoing
ModelResolutionPreferencesPage.resolutionScope.workspace.description = Search for cross-references to (and from) the compared resource within all models from the workspace.
ModelResolutionPreferencesPage.resolutionScope.project.description = Search for cross-references to (and from) the compared resource within all models from its containing project.
ModelResolutionPreferencesPage.resolutionScope.container.description = Search for cross-references to (and from) the compared resource within all models from the same container.
ModelResolutionPreferencesPage.resolutionScope.outgoing.description = Only search for cross-references from the compared resource to its children (and recursively).
ModelResolutionPreferencesPage.resolutionScope.invalid = Invalid resolution scope value.

_UI_NoProblems_message = There are no problems with the computation of the comparison
_UI_DefaultProblem_message = Problems encountered. Click on each problem for further information. The computed comparison and the merge you will do on it may be inaccurate. We suggest you to fix the errors before doing any merge or to switch to text comparison (use 'Text Compare' below)
_UI_Cancel_message = Operation has been canceled. The computed comparison and the merge you will do on it may be inaccurate. We suggest you to be very careful or to switch to text comparison (use 'Text Compare' below)
