=== Content ===

The problem comes from UML dangling stereotypes in UML models. UML dangling stereotypes happen when a stereotype linked to a model element is still in a model while the model element has been removed.

Papyrus offers the possibility to fix dangling stereotypes by removing them.

In 3.1.0 and before, such changes are wrongly detected and displayed as ResourceAttachmentChanges in the comparison models, and displayed to users as "uncontrolled from xxx.uml".

==== Proposal ====

===== Core =====
A new type of ResourceAttachmentChange will be created in the org.eclipse.emf.compare.uml2/model/uml2compare.ecore metamodel. It will be a DanglingStereotypeApplication.

No specific merge work will be done on DanglingStereotypeApplication. That means DanglingStereotypeApplications will be mergeable from left to right or right to left (and accept/reject) without specific control. Thus, the dangling references could be merged into a "clean" model and make it "dirty".

===== UI =====
The DanglingStereotypeApplications will be displayed in red to warn users that there is problem(s) in their models. As a ResourceAttachmentChanges, DanglingStereotypeApplications will be displayed under MatchResources.

[[Image:./images/US_320_001_3.png]]

===== Cases =====
For all cases, consider the following base model.

[[Image:./images/US_320_001_1.png]]

'''Case 1: Dangling stereotype with nothing on the other side'''

[[Image:./images/US_320_001_3.png]]

A merge from left to right of the DanglingStereotypeApplication will lead to delete the dangling stereotype on the right model.
A merge from right to left of the DanglingStereotypeApplication will lead to have the dangling stereotype also on the left model.

'''Case 2: Dangling stereotype with class (without stereotype) on the other side'''

[[Image:./images/US_320_001_4.png]]

A merge from left to right of the DanglingStereotypeApplication will lead to delete the dangling stereotype on the right model.
A merge from right to left of the DanglingStereotypeApplication will lead to have the dangling stereotype also on the left model.

===== Possible Evolution =====
As a possible evolution, specific work could be done on merge to handle case where classes exist on one side and dangling references on the other side (see case 2 above), in order to "re-connect" class and their stereotype application if it is possible (if the id of the targeted element of the stereotype is still there).


==  US_320_002 - Toolbar actions: contextual tooltips ==

=== Description ===

Add contextual tooltips for action buttons in EMF Compare UI.

==== Categories ====
[[./index.html#UI-related Specifications|UI]]

=== Content ===

The tooltips are not contextualized. Each button has the same tooltip for all possible cases. It is confusing for the user. Tooltips for actions and right click menu labels must be context specific. 

==== Proposal ====

===== UI =====

The tooltip must display the best information depending of the context.

'''Proposal'''

The following list suggests tooltips for each possible case.

== US_320_003 - Synchronize view integration ==

=== Description ===
Integration of EMF resource mappings with the Synchronize view. 

==== Categories ====
[[./index.html#Team-related Specifications|Team]], [[./index.html#UI-related Specifications|UI]]

=== Content ===
As a user, I want to easily keep track of the EMF resource mappings (''logical models'' and its containing resources) that I'm currently merging using the Team Synchronizing perspective.

Currently, the Synchronize view shows all resources that have been changed, added, or deleted in the scope of the synchronization. If I double-click a model resource, EMF Compare's merge viewer shows all differences that relate to the double-clicked model resource or the model resources that are part of the same EMF resource mapping as the double-clicked model resource. Consequently, if I double-click ''another'' model resource in the Synchronize view that is part ''of the same EMF resource mapping'', the merge viewer will show the very same changes, but in a different order. If I however double-click ''another'' model resource that is part of ''another EMF resource mapping'', the differences of another (not obviously visible) set of model resources are shown. As a result, users easily get lost during the comparison or merge in the Team Synchronizing perspective. 

In general, it is a problem that EMF Compare's merge viewer operates on the level of EMF resource mappings that potentially span multiple resources while the Synchronize view displays the single resources only that may or may not be part of EMF resource mappings. Especially when multiple EMF resource mappings are in the scope of a synchronization, it is hard to keep track, causing the following issues:

# Users don't see the EMF resource mappings in the Synchronize view
# Users don't see which model resources they are currently working on in EMF Compare's merge viewer (except if they switch to the ''By Resource'' group)
# Users don't easily see which model resources relate to which resource in the Synchronize view even when using the ''By Resource'' group (as it only shows the file names but not the project and path, doesn't use the same hierarchy and icons, etc.)
# Users don't see how many EMF resource mappings are in the scope of the change that need to be merged or resolved

==== Proposal ====
The goal of this proposal is three-fold and should be addressed in three iterations:
# ''Extend the Synchronize view'' to be aware of and display EMF resource mappings
# ''Extend the structure merge viewer'' content so that users can directly relate its content to the structure in the Synchronize view
# ''Link the Synchronize view and the structure merge viewer'' so that it shows which model resource we have currently selected

===== 1. Extend the Synchronize view =====

To realize the first goal, we propose to use the extension points ''org.eclipse.team.ui.teamContentProviders'' and ''org.eclipse.ui.navigator.navigatorContent'' as done for Git commits. Once those extension points are implemented, we obtain a new ''model'' (in the sense of the Team API) that we suggest to name ''EMF Logical Models''.

[[Image:./images/US_320_003_1_1.png]]

Once ''EMF Logical Models'' is selected, the Synchronize view shows only model resources and groups them according to the logical models. 

[[Image:./images/US_320_003_1_2.png]]

===== 2. Extend the structure merge viewer =====

To make it easier for users to relate the content of the structure merge viewer to the content of the Synchronize view, we propose to add an ''EMF resource mapping'' group for the structure merge viewer that shows the exact same content as in the Synchronize view for the respective EMF resource mapping currently compared, but ''in addition'' the differences of the involved model resources.

[[Image:./images/US_320_003_2.png]]

===== 3. Link the Synchronize view and the structure merge viewer =====

Without having a concrete technical solution in mind, we think users would benefit from linking the selections between the structure merge viewer and the Synchronize view: if a match or difference is selected in the content merge viewer, EMF Compare should select the respective resource that contains the selected match or the match that contains the selected difference in the Synchronize view. Vice versa, if a model resource is selected or double-clicked (and the content merge viewer shows the same EMF resource mapping already), EMF Compare should leave the content of the content merge viewer unchanged and select the respective resource in the content merge viewer tree. Users should however be able to activate or deactivate linking among views, as usual in Eclipse.

Note that it seems that we unfortunately cannot directly use ''Link with Editor'' of the Synchronize view as it requires the comparison editor to have an editor input that adapts to the respective resource to be linked. However, in the content merge viewer, we would have to change the respective resource according to the selection.

== US_320_004 - Comparisons and merges involving resource changes ==

=== Description ===
Management of resource moves and renames with ResourceAttachmentChanges.
Management of the move of a root node of a model resource that contains one or several root nodes (which is necessary for Papyrus notation resources for instance).

==== Categories ====
[[./index.html#Core-related Specifications|Core]], [[./index.html#Team-related Specifications|Team]], [[./index.html#UI-related Specifications|UI]]

=== Content ===

The notion of <code>ResourceLocationChange</code> introduced in a previous version of EMFCompare has limits as soon as resources with several roots are involved in comparisons.
Actually, <code>ResourceLocationChange</code> is only relevant for resources with one root, which is limited and wrong.
Consequently, we introduce the notion of <code>ResourceAttachmentChange</code> with kind <code>MOVE</code>. <code>ResourceLocationChange</code> is consequently deprecated.

This change also implies to modify the way we handle the matching of resources.
Before, when using <code>ResourceLocationChange</code>s to manage the renaming or move or resources, we had to be able to match 2 resources that did not have the same name or path.
Now, with the use of <code>ResourceAttachmentChange/MOVE</code>, we don't have to artificially match 2 resources located in different places.
This is especially more robust when working with git repositories, since in this case comparisons can be handled by matching resources accroding only to their path.
When dealing with EGit, 2 resources with different paths will never be matched.
This does not prevent a <code>ResourceAttachmentChange</code> of kind <code>MOVE</code> to be created, since such a change is attached to the moved root element.

'''''IMPORTANT RESTRICTION'''''<br/>
''Please note that this specification only supports moves of root nodes for EGit comparisons.''<br/>
''Such moves will not be properly detected for local comparisons, since the paths of resources will then always be different.''

However, this solution is more robust, more powerful since it allows to manage resource with several roots (which is the case of GMF notaionf resources for instance), and also more elegant since it does not break the general contract of diffs like <code>ResourceLocationChange</code> did.

This change is accompanied by EGit-specific and papyrus-specific classes registered through extension points:

* <code>EGitPostProcessor</code> in project <code>org.eclipse.emf.compare.egit</code>
** is used to actually create the <code>ResourceAttachmentChange</code> with kind <code>MOVE</code>
* <code>PapyrusResourceAttachmentChangeMerger</code> in project <code>org.eclipse.emf.compare.diagram.ide.ui.papyrus</code>
** is used to merge papyrus-specific empty resources, which contain no model element to which any diff can be attached. This is necessary to properly create or delete empty resources such as *.di files, or sometimes empty *.notation files also.

== US_320_007 - Remove EMFCompareConfiguration from EMFCompareRCPUIPlugin and extract Graph in a separate plug-in ==

=== Description ===
Depreciate the access to <code>EMFCompareConfiguration</code> in the <code>EMFCompareRCPUIPlugin</code>.<br/>
Depreciate the access to <code>Graph</code> in <code>EMFCompareConfiguration</code>.<br/>
Extract the management of the dependency graph from EMFCompare to its own plugin.

==== Categories ====
[[./index.html#Core-related Specifications|Core]]

=== Content ===

==== specification ====
The graphs used by EMFCompare are currently computed and managed by an internal class in <code>org.eclipse.emf.compare</code> bundle. The URI resources graph is shared by all comparisons, its instance being held by the <code>ThreadedModelResolver</code>. Since the bundle <code>org.eclipse.emf.compare.ide.ui</code> needs to access this graph, it is passed throught the <code>EMFCompareConfiguration</code> which is accessible in the <code>EMFCompareRCPUIPlugin</code>.
The <code>EMFCompareRCPUIPlugin</code> and the URI resources Graph are singletons and used for all comparisons. On the other hand, the <code>EMFCompareConfiguration</code> is specific to each comparison and recreated each time. 
It seems that the <code>EMFCompareConfiguration</code> has been put in the <code>EMFCompareRCPUIPlugin</code> only to allow the transfert of the URI resources graph and the <code>StructureMergeViewerFilter</code> between plugins. A solution to give access to the URI resources graph is to create a new plugin with the creation and managment of graphs as responsibility. The <code>StructureMergeViewerFilter</code> which is given by the <code>EMFCompareConfiguration</code> through the <code>EMFCompareRCPUIPlugin</code> must be give in another way. A solution is to give it through the <code>TreeItemAdapterFactorySpec</code>. 
This work done, the field <code>compareConfiguration</code> and the methods <code>getEMFCompareConfiguration</code> and <code>setEMFCompareConfiguration</code> will be deprecated, and will not have any effects anymore.

Several different graphs are used during a comparison. The URI resources graph is the only one to be unique for all comparisons. The other graphs are comparison specific.
To handle the previously expressed needs, several actions must be performed:
* Extract the classes <code>Graph</code> and <code>ReadOnlyGraph</code> in a new plugin <code>org.eclipse.emf.compare.graph</code>
* The plugin must be a singleton
* The resource graph must be accessible from the plugin added
* The class <code>Graph</code> must remain accessible for comparison needs.

==== test cases ====
The work will be tested by non-regression tests
 
== Improve performance of conflict detection on large model ==
=== Description ===
As a '''user''',<br/>
I want to '''be able to compare large model (50'000 model elements) with many differences (~30'000 differences) in a reasonable time (less than 1 minute)'''<br/>
so that '''I can compare large models without disrupting my work flow'''

==== Analysis ====
Users who deal with large models complain about the duration of comparisons, especially when a large number of differences is involved.
This is mostly due to:
* The logical model computation (which has however been deeply optimized and for which we lack ideas for improvements)
* The computation of conflicts, because the algorithm implement in class <code>DefaultConflictDetector</code> is ''O(n²)''
An analysis of this algorithm showed that it could be improved to scale much better

==== Design ====
We introduce a new implementation of <code>IConflictDetector</code> called <code>FastConflictDetector</code>.

Instead of iterating over each diff and, for each of them, going over every other diff to check whether it conflicts with it,
the fast conflict detector iterates over each diff and, for each of them, looks for conflict candidates in specific relevant places.
These places are:
* The current diff's <code>Match</code>
* The (indexed) <code>ReferenceChange</code>s that point to the "same" value as the current diff, only if diff is a '''containment''' <code>ReferenceChange</code>.
Consequently, the number of candidates to check for conflict is much smaller than in the default algorithm.

Technically, the implementation delegates the search for candidates to an instance of a specific class, which is instantiated by a factory which takes into account the type and the kind of the diff. This allows the code to be more readable and thus maintainable than previously, because each method acts in a more specific context, which reduces the number of <code>fi</code> statements, for instance. Each of these classes shares behavior by extending a common abstract class.

==== Test Cases ====
The testing strategy is the following:
* to run all the existing tests with both the DefaultConflictDetector and the FastConflictDetector, and to check the results are identical.
* to run manual tests on large models to make sure the user time is reasonable (less than 1 minute for a model as described above)
* to verify the positive impact on the nightly EMFCompare performance measurements
