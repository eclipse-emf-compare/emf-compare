	Two diffs on BookOnTape.reader : has been removed from both local and remote copies (pseudo-conflict).
	Two diffs on Periodical.title : it has been removed in right, and its container (Periodical) has been entirely removed from left.
	
	No equivalences.
	
	Conflicts on :
	1 and 15 : Not a generic conflict, relies on ecore-specific business rules : enum literals of the same enum with the same 'value'.
	8, 19 and 23 : REAL : locally deleted Periodical. However, we've remotely set "Periodical" as the super-type of Magazine.
	31, 45, 32 and 46 : PSEUDO : We've removed title both locally and remotely, which is a PSEUDO conflict. 
	12 and 27 : REAL : remote renaming of a locally deleted attribute
	14 and 28 : REAL : renaming to different values
	29, 30, 33 and 34 : PSEUDO : BookOnTape.reader removed from both sides, and thus its type unset on both sides.
