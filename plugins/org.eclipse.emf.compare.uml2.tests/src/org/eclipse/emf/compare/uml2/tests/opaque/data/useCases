Use Cases for merging bodies of OpaqueBehaviors
===============================================

A1
--
Opaque action with one body attribute value that is concurrently modified in a
mergeable way (i.e., at different lines).

A2
--
Opaque action with one body attribute value that is concurrently modified in a
non-mergeable way (i.e., conflict).

A3
--
Opaque action with two body attribute values, whereas the second is concurrently
modified in a non-mergeable way (i.e., conflict) and the first one is changed in
a mergeable way (i.e., no conflict).

A4
--
Opaque action with one body attribute value that is changed on the right-hand side
and on the left-hand side a new language and body has been added (i.e., mergeable).

A5
--
Opaque action with one body attribute value that is unchanged, but both sides add
different new languages and bodies (i.e., mergeable).

A6
--
Opaque action with two body attribute values, whereas one is changed on the both
sides but on different lines (i.e., mergeable) and on the right-hand side the order
of the language/body values is changed (i.e., mergeable).

A7
--
Opaque action with two body attribute values, whereas one is changed on the both
sides on the same line (i.e., conflict) and additionally on the right-hand side
the order of the language/body values is changed.

A8
--
Opaque action with one body attribute value that is unchanged, but both sides add
same new language value with different body (i.e., conflict).

A9
--
Opaque action with one body attribute value that is deleted on the left-hand side
and left unchanged on the right-hand side.

A10
---
Opaque action with two body attribute values, whereas one is deleted and the other one
is changed left-hand side and on the right-hand side the one that has been changed on the
left-hand side is also changed in a mergeable way.

A11
---
Opaque action with two body attribute values, whereas one is deleted and the other one
is changed left-hand side and on the right-hand side the one that has been changed on the
left-hand side is also changed in a non-mergeable way (conflict).

A12
---
Opaque action with two body attribute values, whereas one is deleted and the other one
is changed left-hand side and on the right-hand side the one that has been changed on the
left-hand side is deleted (delete-update conflict).

A13
---
Opaque action with two body attribute values, whereas one is deleted and the other one
is changed left-hand side and on the right-hand side the one that has been deleted on
the left-hand side is deleted too (delete-delete -> no conflict).

B1
--
Same as A1 but with OpaqueBehaviors.

E1
--
Same as A1 but with OpaqueExpressions.
