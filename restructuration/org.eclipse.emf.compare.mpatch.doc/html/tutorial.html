<h1>MPatch Tutorial</h1>

<p>Quick overview of what you learn in the tutorial:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup example project</li>
<li>Compare two models with EMF Compare</li>
<li>Create MPatch from EMF Compare comparison</li>
<li>Apply MPatch to another model</li>
</ul>
<p>The contents of this tutorial is also shown in the (outdated) <a href="http://modeldiff.imm.dtu.dk/modeldiff/index2.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=70&Itemid=67" target="_blank">screencasts</a>; please note that the screencasts use the old term <i>model-independent differences</i> instead of <i>MPatch</i>.</p>
<hr title="Setup example project" alt="Setup example project" />
<p>The tutorial uses a shipped example for illustrations. To import it into your workspace, select <em>Window</em> -> <em>Show View</em> -> <em>Other...</em> -> <em>Plug-ins</em>, and look for the plugin <em>org.eclipse.emf.compare.mpatch.example</em>. Right click it and select <em>Import As</em> -> <em>Source Project</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/import_example.png" border="0" alt="Import example" title="Import example" /></p>
<p>You should now have a project available in your workspace containing the following files:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/files.png" border="0" alt="Example models" title="Example models" /></p>
<p><em>model/library.ecore</em> - the base version of a simple library model  <br /><em>model/library_karl.ecore</em> - a modified version of the base version <br /><em>model/library_eve.ecore</em> - another modified version of the base version</p>
<p>The <em>.ecorediag</em>-files are diagrams for the models. If you installed the Ecore Tools, you should be able to open these files and view the models graphically.</p>
<hr title="Model-comparison with EMF Compare" alt="Model-comparison with EMF Compare" />
<p>At the moment, <em>MPatches</em> are not created directly, but from existing differences created with EMF Compare. The reason is that we do not want to introduce yet another model-comparison algorithm but instead use existing solutions which are already flexible and exdendable.</p>
<p>To compare <em>library.ecore</em> and <em>library_karl.ecore</em>, select both files, right click and select <em>Compare With</em> -> <em>Each Other</em>. Then a model comparison dialog should open which shows both model and their differences in EMF Compare:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/emfdiff.png" border="0" alt="EMF Compare" title="EMF Compare" /></p>
<hr title="MPatch creation" alt="MPatch creation" />
<p>The process of creating MPatches involves a set of optional transformations which add further features as explained below.</p>
<p>There are currently two ways of starting the transformations:</p>
<ol>
<li>From within the comparison dialog: Select 'Export as MPatch' (see previous screenshot).</li>
<li>From an <em>.emfdiff</em>-file which was previously saved from a comparison dialog ('Export as emfdiff') by right-clicking it and selecting <em>MPatch</em> -> <em>Transform emfdiff to MPatch</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, a wizard for the creation of MPatches is started. Select the <em>library</em> folder as the parent folder and enter <em>karls_diff.mpatch</em> as a file name. Select the transformations 'Intuitive Grouping', 'Scope Expansion', and 'Unbound Symbolic References' on the next wizard page (their order doesn't matter), make sure the <em>Condition-based symbolic reference creator</em> is selected, and press <em>Finish</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/create.png" border="0" alt="Optional transformations" title="Optional transformations" /></p>
<p>The <em>Intuitive Grouping</em> structures the changes in groups. <em>Unbound Symbolic References</em> makes changes not only applicable to one single but to a set of model-elements. <em>Scope Expansion</em> modifies the MPatch such that the changes are applicable to slightly changed models. The <em>condition-based symbolic reference creator</em> produces references which are required by some of the transformations.<br />Please see <a href="http://modeldiff.imm.dtu.dk/modeldiff/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=61&Itemid=66">this page</a> for more detailed explanations.</p>
<p>Next you should see a summary of the transformation results and you should have a file <em>library/karls_diffs.mpatch</em> in your example project:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/result.png" border="0" alt="Transformation result" title="Transformation result" /></p>
<hr title="MPatch application" alt="MPatch application" />
<p>Now we are going to apply the just created differences to the other model.</p>
<p>Right-click <em>karls_diff.mpatch</em> and select <em>MPatch</em> -> <em>Apply MPatch</em>. This opens the wizard for MPatch application:</p>
<ol>
<li> Selection of MPatch<br /><img src="images/apply1.png" border="0" alt="Select MPatch for application" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>Selection of the model to which the MPatch should be applied;<br />please select <em>model/library_eve.ecore</em> from the workspace here.<br /><img src="images/apply2.png" border="0" alt="Select target model" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>Resolution of symbolic references;<br />this page is the most important for MPatch application--in order to effectively use MPatches, you need to understand what happens here:<br />It defines to which model elements (the model was choosen in the previous step) each individual change should be applied.<br />The symbols have the following meaning:<br /><img src="images/tut_apply_blue.png" border="0" width="16" height="16" /> -- The number of resolved model elements does not match the required number<br /><img src="images/tut_apply_red.png" border="0" width="16" height="16" /> -- The change is not applicable to the set of selected model elements<br /> <img src="images/tut_apply_green.png" border="0" /> -- Resolution is ok, the change can be applied.<br />The number of resolved model elements can be changed by clicking the button [...] in the table cell which shows the resolved model elements.<br /><img src="images/apply3.png" border="0" alt="Resolve symbolic references" /><br />Note that a change can be applied to multiple model elements at once because if the 'Unbound Symbolic References' transformation was performed!<br />Note also that the user can make a selection by ticking (thus ignoring) changes, which is already done for the unknown changes.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Storing an intermediate emfdiff (optional);<br />If the intermediate models should be saved after the application process (ticking <em>Store intermediate models</em> in step 3), then the wizards asks for a place to store the emfdiff file.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Storing an intermediate model (optional);<br />If the intermediate models should be saved, the wizards asks for a place to store a copy of the model selected in step 2.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Review all settings;<br />
When clicking <i>Finish</i>, a message confirms the application of the four changes. If <em>Review result with EMF Compare</em> is ticked, then a comparison of the unchanged and the changed model is opened afterwards.<br /><img src="images/apply4.png" border="0" alt="Review all settings" /><br /><img src="images/application.png" border="0" alt="Review all settings" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>Review result with EMF Compare (optional);<br />EMF Compare opens and shows all applied changes in a comparison view. Please note that due to a <a href="/modeldiff/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&catid=38%3Abugs-and-features&id=57%3Abug-visualization-of-differences-after-difference-application&Itemid=57">bug (or feature?!) in EMF Compare</a>, any changes in this view are discarded if the intermediate models are not saved.<img src="images/final_compare.png" border="0" alt="Review all settings" /><br />
Now we can see:
<ul>
<li><i>Citylibrary.authors</i> was added although the original class was <i>Library</i>.
<li><i>Book.authors</i> (attribute) has been deleted although the original feature was called <i>author</i> and the book was located in another package.
<li><i>Book.authors</i> (reference) has been added although the original class was located in another package.
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Now you know the basic steps to use MPatches.</p>
